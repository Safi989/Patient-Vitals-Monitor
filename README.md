Patient Vital Monitor

Real-Time Health Monitoring Dashboard Built with Flask and React



Introduction:

The Patient Vitals Monitor is a real-time health monitoring system that simulates and displays critical patient vital signs, including heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen level, and temperature. Built with Flask RESTful API backend and a React frontend, this project shows full-stack development skills, API design, real-time data handling, and clean UI implementation.

This project demonstrates skills in:
* Full-stack development 
* API integration and JSON data handling 
* State management and periodic polling for life updates 
* Data formatting and UI design

The application is ideal for scenarios where continuous patient monitoring is required, such as remote healthcare systems, hospital dashboards, or research experiments.
